Hey all, wanted to share a little workflow I’ve been using a lot lately.

So I got [this classical-esque](https://suno.com/song/072f4d45-9e9f-4a6c-9d56-55988e54d4bf) generation months ago, and I’ve been wanting to use it ever since. Finally, it fit perfectly as an overture for my upcoming “metalcore opera,” so I worked on it and, after a lot of inpainting, I got [this version complete with a modulation and some nice vinyl noises](https://suno.com/song/bec19e77-d357-41ba-86fa-d348840ee732).

Now, like any good opera, I thought I should have the same theme repeated somewhere else during the album, so I got an idea to make a cover of it in a more “metal” style, and here where my “tricks” come in:

0. First (this is not a trick yet), I created dozens of covers of the song in various metal subgenres, and finally decided upon [this Trap Metal cover](https://suno.com/song/d694c11e-b4bc-4940-995b-4d5783c4e6b9). To me, this genre never fails to deliver, giving metal energy in a very “modern-sounding” form.

1. Here comes the first trick: Instead of going with your favorite cover right away, generate **some more covers of this cover**. This will keep the focus of your composition near that good cover, but but will play around some of the stuff (whether sound or music-wise). You can even keep the prompt the same because the results will *not* be the same. But in this case I ended up with [this magnificent Phonk Metal take](https://suno.com/song/c1a69156-7d8f-4004-aba7-ef6e1e7a5f4c). Phonk gives a more raw, primal sound than Trap, which in many cases can work nicely, and it did (for me) here.

But while I was coming up with this version, I also had [this beautiful Spanish-guitar cover](https://suno.com/song/326c84e0-e72e-412c-b6f8-9428bdaacd7c). I knew I just couldn’t let it go. So, after considering putting both versions on the album, I came up with the idea to…

2. Merge them together! The song would start with a gentle acoustic etude, and then suddenly go into  electronic metal power, so that’s exactly what I did:

As you can see, where the interlude starts in the “metal” version, I re-punched in the acoustic version with a little fade-in, resulting in both versions going together to a powerful culmination.

3. Then, I re-uploaded the entire “mash,” cut at around the point where the covers started diverging, and extended it to [this final result](https://suno.com/song/7f003445-05fe-428b-a386-a55b8822c510) — which I leave up to you to decide on the goodness of!

Thanks for reading — let me know what you think and if you have any tips of your own!

TL;DR:

1. When doing Covers, pick the best Cover you have and then Cover it some more to nail the sound and development.
2. Merge different covers together for unexpected musical decisions.
3. Extend from merged covers to bring the piece to its final form.

P.S. Of course, I only post the final takes of each of the steps above; there were dozens and dozens at each step that were discarded (even if some of them were great).
