<!-- ## Restoring your old Jukebox songs with Suno: Pick your battles wisely

*November 11, 2024*

**Note: While the story below relates to restoring Jukebox songs, the same principles apply to restoring any other songs you might have created that deserve a second chance — wether your age-old Guitar Pro experimentations, your bedroom-produced tracks that sound like a cat in heat, or your high school band’s rehearsal tapes.**

If you were into AI-generated music before Suno arrived, you probably have a bunch of songs created with Jukebox, OpenAI’s first (and only) music generation model. And if you’re like me, you probably have mixed feelings about them. On the one hand, they were the best thing we had at the time, and they were a lot of fun to create. On the other hand, even with all the tricks you could pull off, they still sounded like, let’s be honest, crap.

As I was creating those songs back then, I dreamt of a day when I could restore them with a better model. And since Suno introduced Covers — the ability to generate a song using another song as a prompt — I’ve been having a blast doing just that.

In the last couple of months, I’ve Covered three of my (dozens of) old instrumentation-only songs (tracks 8–10 on the [latest GENERATED album](https://generated.bandcamp.com/album/let-the-stories-spin)) and released an entire [album of my father’s songs](https://poluzhivye.bandcamp.com/album/papa-reka) in his memoriam — but I only released my [first Jukebox restoration](tbd) today, so I thought I’d share some thoughts on the process. -->

## Disintegration Tango: An old Jukebox song restored with Suno (including tips & tricks)

*November 11, 2024*

Ever since Suno introduced Covers — the ability to generate a song using another song as a prompt — I’ve been having a blast restoring my old songs. In the last couple of months, I’ve Covered three of my (dozens of) old MIDI tracks (tracks 8–10 on the [latest GENERATED album](https://spti.fi/generated-stories)) and released an entire [album of my father’s songs](https://spti.fi/papa-reka) in his memoriam.

But [this one](https://spti.fi/tango) is the first time I got to restoring my old Jukebox songs. It’s called “Disintegration Tango,” and it was one of the better-sounding ones I had back then. Still, even with [all the tips & tricks for improving quality](/misc/tbw.md), even the best Jukebox sound pales in comparison to what Suno can do today, so I was excited to see what I could do with it.

First of all, here’s the original Jukebox song for reference:
