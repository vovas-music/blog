## Welcome to Vova’s music blog

Hey all,

My name is Vova, and I’ve been creating music for as long as I can remember. In the past two years, I mostly entirely focused on AI-generated music, and I’ve been having a blast. Bringing your ideas to life in hours or days instead of weeks or months is a game-changer (especially when you suck at sound engineering as much as I do).

In this blog, I’ll be sharing my thoughts, tips and tricks related music creation in general, and AI-generated music in particular. These will be especially useful if you’re using AI to create music, but there will be plenty of general advice on songwriting and storytelling as well — although I’m anything but a “guru” in these areas, so take these with a grain of salt.

I make all my music open-source, so feel free to browse [this GitHub org](https://github.com/vovas-music) to see what I’ve been up to. (You’d need REAPER installed to open the projects, but it’s the best DAW out there anyway, so you should have it installed already.)

P.S. I know running a blog on GitHub looks weird, but I’m too lazy to set up a proper website. So here we are.
